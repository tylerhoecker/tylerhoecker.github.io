## Landscape position amplifies consequences of short-interval fires on postfire tree establishment in Yellowstone's subalpine forests 

Stand-replacing fires at long 100 to 300-year intervals have shaped boreal and subalpine conifer forests of the western North America for millennia. Native tree species are well adapted to such fires, allowing forest management to rely on successful natural postfire tree regeneration. Projected large increases in fire frequency as climate warms represent a substantial disruption of the historical fire regime. Postfire tree regeneration is reduced when young forests reburn, but whether landscape position may further depress tree regeneration in short-interval stand-replacing fires is not known. We conducted an experiment in areas across the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (Wyoming, USA) that burned during short-interval fires (< 30 years; “reburns”) to answer three questions: (1) How do germination, survival, and thus establishment of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca) vary by landscape position following high-severity, short-interval fires? (2) What environmental factors best predict regeneration of both species? (3) Within 2016 reburns, where will topographic variation enhance or constrain the probability of tree seedling establishment? 

This work is being prepared for resubmission, and pre-print and slides from my presentation on this work at the 2019 Association for Fire Ecology Congress are available upon request.
