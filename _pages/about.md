I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the Univeristy of Wisconsin-Madison, where I work in [Dr. Monica Turner's Ecosystem and Landscape Ecology Lab](http://landscape.zoology.wisc.edu/index.html). 

##  Research interests 

Natural and human systems across the globe are changing at unprecedented rates. My research centers around understanding the drivers of environmental change at ecosystem,landscape and biome scales. I am interested in how disturbances shape the structure and function of systems, integrate processes across scales, catalyze environmental change, and vary through time and space. Fire, as a key driver of material and energy cycling, species composition, and ecosystem function across much of North Americaâ€™s forests, is the focus of my graduate research. 

My Ph.D. dissertation is broadly focused on identifying the mechansisms that control subalpine forest regeneration after fire in the U.S. northern Rocky Mountains, and anticipating the trajectory of forest structure, composition and function into the 21st century.  

For my MS at the University of Montana, I reconstructed the last 450+ years of fire activity in an Alaskan interior boreal forest landscape to explore interactions among fire, climate and tree establishment. I also synthesized a body of paleofire records from across the Alaskan boreal forest to characterize biome-scale patterns and drivers of fire activity during the Holocene.

##  Personal interests 

My passion for exploring the natural world is what led me to science, and I enjoy a variety of methods for doing so: by foot, bike, ski, and on rock. I also love to enjoy the local foods and beverages of Madison.
