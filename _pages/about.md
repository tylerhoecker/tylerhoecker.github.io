I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the Univeristy of Wisconsin-Madison, where I work in [Dr. Monica Turner's Ecosystem and Landscape Ecology Lab](http://landscape.zoology.wisc.edu/index.html). 

##  Research interests 

My dissertation asks how climate change and more fire will alter the character and function of forests across the northern US Rocky Mountains. I’m using experimental, observational and simulation modeling studies to disentangle the interacting drivers of change and anticipate future ecosystem trajectories. My current projects investigate changes in the structure and composition of forests after short-interval fires, identify where fire could catalyze novel regeneration trajectories, and anticipate the consequences of fire-regime change for wildlife habitat.

Natural and human systems across the globe are changing at unprecedented rates. My research seeks to understand how fire -a key driver of material and energy cycling, species composition, and ecosystem function across much of North America’s forests- will shape the future of forest ecosystems and impact their role in broader coupled social-ecological systems. 

Landscape ecology focuses on how the spatial relationships of processes constrain their behavior, but is also explicitly concerned with the ways that human and non-human processes interact. My work seeks to use the mechanistic insights gained from ecological research to inform forest management. I ask basic ecological questions: How do forests respond to rare or novel disturbances? What are the biophysical constraints on tree regeneration? But these have significant implications for our relationship with ecosystems: What services do we gain or lose when forests become grasslands? How does reorganization of forests impact animal biodiversity? My work has a home in landscape ecology because it sits at the intersection of complex ecological and social questions.

For my MS in [Dr. Philip Higuera's PaleoEcology and Fire Ecology Lab](https://www.cfc.umt.edu/research/paleoecologylab/) at the University of Montana, I reconstructed the last 450+ years of fire activity in an Alaskan interior boreal forest landscape to explore interactions among fire, climate and tree establishment. I also synthesized a body of paleofire records from across the Alaskan boreal forest to characterize biome-scale patterns and drivers of fire activity during the Holocene.

##  Personal interests 

My passion for exploring the natural world is what led me to science, and I enjoy a variety of methods for doing so: by foot, bike, ski, and on rock. I also enjoy the vibrant local and international food scene Madison.

Before beginning graduate school, I spent six months living aboard a small sailboat in the south Pacific. You can [download "Ocean Wilderness", a collection of photographs and essays I produced on the experience](/assets/pdfs/OceanWilderness.pdf)
