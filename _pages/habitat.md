Climate change will profoundly influence wildlife populations by directly altering environmental conditions and through novel disturbance regimes that affect habitat quantity and quality. In the northern US Rocky Mountains, increased fire activity could fundamentally change habitat availability for forest species adapted to historical fire regimes. We asked how alternative future scenarios of warming climate and increased fire in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (Wyoming, USA) could affect habitat area for pine marten (PIMA, Martes americana) and Black-backed woodpecker (BBWO, Picoides arcticus) during the 21st century. BBWO is a burned-forest specialist, favoring severely burned (>90% mortality) stands of dense (>200 trees/ha) large (>20 cm diameter) conifers, which provide abundant food and nesting resources. PIMA favors late-seral structurally complex conifer forests (75â€° tree age > 80 years) with large trees (>20 cm diameter) and areas of continuous canopy cover (basal area >18 m2 ha-1) that support their prey. We combined habitat suitability models with projected forest structures for a 500 km2 landscape around Grand Teton National Park simulated using the spatial, process-based model iLand. We estimated habitat area for both species through 2100 for several future climate scenarios. In scenarios where warmer, drier conditions promoted more fire, BBWO habitat increased through the mid-21st century to a maximum of ~9000 ha in 2040, then declined to ~500 ha by 2090 as tree size, density and cover declined. In contrast, PIMA habitat area declined steadily from ~28000 ha in 2020 to ~2700 ha in 2090 as tree density, age and cover declined. However, when precipitation also increased with warming and fire activity did not, BBWO and PIMA habitat both declined continuously, but PIMA habitat was higher in 2100 than warmer scenarios. Effects of climate- and fire-driven changes in forest landscapes will affect wildlife species differently and may lead to surprising changes in 21st-century wildlife assemblages.
